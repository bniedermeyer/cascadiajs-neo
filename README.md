# CascadiaJS

The website for [CascadiaJS](https://cascadiajs.com), the Pacific Northwest's web + AI developer conference. It's a static [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) site styled with [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), with all content and data stored in this repo. It deploys to Netlify.

This README is the onboarding guide. Read it top to bottom once, then return to the section you need.

New to Astro or Tailwind? Skim the Astro docs on [project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/), [components](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/), [layouts](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/) and [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/), and Tailwind's [core concepts](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes). This guide assumes you know that much.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node 22.12 or newer and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) 12.7 (pinned in `package.json` under `packageManager`). Use `pnpm`, never `npm` or `npx`. For one-off binaries, use `pnpm exec`.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:4321
```

| Command        | What it does                                            |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm dev`     | Dev server with hot reload at `localhost:4321`          |
| `pnpm build`   | Production build to `dist/`                             |
| `pnpm preview` | Serve the built `dist/` locally                         |
| `pnpm check`   | Type-check `.astro` and `.ts` files (`astro check`)     |
| `pnpm lint`    | ESLint (`pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix)                    |
| `pnpm test`    | Build, preview, and run the Playwright end-to-end suite |

A pre-commit hook (Husky + lint-staged) runs ESLint `--fix` and Prettier on staged files. Type checks and tests run in CI.

## How we work

### Issues and triage labels

We track work in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bniedermeyer/cascadiajs-neo/issues). Each issue carries one triage label:

| Label             | Meaning                                                                |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`    | New. Waiting for a maintainer to evaluate it                           |
| `needs-info`      | Waiting on the reporter for more detail                                |
| `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified. An agent can implement it unattended                  |
| `ready-for-human` | Needs a person: judgment calls, design taste, or access an agent lacks |
| `wontfix`         | We will not work on it                                                 |

The `ready-for-agent` and `ready-for-human` labels decide who builds a ticket: an agent or you. An agent-ready issue has acceptance criteria that an agent can check without asking questions. If you take a `ready-for-agent` issue and it is not fully specified, relabel it instead of guessing.

### Branches, commits and PRs

- Create a branch from `main`. Open a PR into `main`.
- Commit messages use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`. Read `git log` for examples of the house style.
- CI must be green before merge. It runs lint, a Prettier check, `astro check`, a production build, and the Playwright suite. See [Testing and CI](#testing-and-ci).
- If you change something this README documents (layouts, routing, content shape, commands, workflow, recipes), update the matching section in the same PR.

### Decisions and vocabulary

- [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) is the glossary. Use its terms in code, issues and PRs.
- [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) holds the architecture decision records. Read the ADRs that touch an area before changing it. To reverse a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one, and leave the old one in place.

### Imports

Imports that cross top-level `src/` directories use path aliases, never `../`:

```ts
import EventLayout from "@layouts/EventLayout.astro";
import CtaButton from "@components/CtaButton.astro";
import { getTickets } from "@shared/data/events";
import hero from "@assets/images/hero-camper.png";
```

The aliases are `@components`, `@layouts`, `@shared` and `@assets`. Stylesheets stay relative (`../styles/global.css`). **ESLint fails on a relative import into an aliased directory**, including from `markdown/` and `e2e/`, so the pre-commit hook and CI will catch it.

## Key terms

The full glossary is in [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md). You'll meet these four throughout the code:

- **Event**: one annual CascadiaJS conference, such as CascadiaJS 2026.
- **Event Key**: the short id that ties data to an Event: a year (`"2026"`) or the bucket `"previous"` for older sponsors. In code, the `EventYear` type holds a value that can only be a real year, and you can name that value `year`. Anything that can hold `previous` is an Event Key.
- **Featured Event**: the one Event the site-wide pages (homepage, header, footer, legal and general content pages) promote. `FEATURED_EVENT` in `src/shared/site-defaults.ts` sets it, and you change it when a new Event launches. An Event's own pages always refer to _that_ Event, never to the Featured Event.
- **Event Dataset**: an Event's Talks (each with its Speaker), Organizers, Tickets and Activities, stored under `src/shared/data/<year>/`. Sponsors and Testimonials span Events, so they aren't part of it.

## Pages and routing

There are two kinds of page.

**Hand-written pages** are `.astro` files in `src/pages/`. The file path is the URL: `src/pages/2026/schedule.astro` serves `/2026/schedule`. Use these for anything with custom structure: the homepage, the Event landing page, the schedule, Talk pages, and the legal pages.

**Content pages** are Markdown files in `markdown/`, served by two catch-all routes:

| File                                   | URL                         | Route                              |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `markdown/code-of-conduct.md`          | `/code-of-conduct`          | `src/pages/[...slug].astro`        |
| `markdown/2026/attend.mdx`             | `/2026/attend`              | `src/pages/[year]/[...slug].astro` |
| `markdown/2026/next-steps/speakers.md` | `/2026/next-steps/speakers` | `src/pages/[year]/[...slug].astro` |

A file under a year folder only gets a page if that Event has a config in `src/shared/data/events/` (see [Launching a new Event](#launching-a-new-event)). Set `published: false` in frontmatter to keep a page out of the build.

Two more dynamic routes generate pages from data. `src/pages/2026/talks/[slug].astro` makes one page per Talk with a `slug`. `src/pages/[year]/sponsors/[slug].astro` makes one page per Sponsor with a `description`, for each Event that the Sponsor sponsored. See Astro's [routing guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/) for how `[param]` and `[...rest]` routes and `getStaticPaths` work.

**URLs never end in a slash.** `/2026/attend` works. `/2026/attend/` does not. Write every internal link without a trailing slash. The root `/` is the only exception. An e2e test scans every built page and fails on a slashed internal link. `Layout` builds canonical URLs from `routePath()` in `src/shared/route-path.ts`. If a page needs its own path, call `routePath()` instead of reading `Astro.url.pathname`.

## Layouts: which one to use

| Layout           | Use it for                                                                           | What it adds                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Layout`         | Site-wide pages that don't belong to an Event: homepage, legal pages, 404            | The whole document: `<head>` (title, description, canonical, Open Graph), site header and footer, global CSS                  |
| `EventLayout`    | Every page that belongs to an Event                                                  | Wraps `Layout`, adds the Event nav bar, and defaults the description and share image from the Event's config. Requires `year` |
| `MarkdownLayout` | Non-Event content pages. **Don't import it yourself.** The `[...slug]` route uses it | Wraps `Layout` and `SimplePage`, styles the Markdown, and appends Past Sponsors and Testimonials (toggled by frontmatter)     |
| `SimplePage`     | Any page that's mostly a column of text under a title bar                            | Not a full page: the grey title bar and a narrow (50%) or wide (70%) content column. Nest it inside `Layout` or `EventLayout` |

Rules of thumb:

- Start from the page's owner. If it belongs to an Event, use `EventLayout`. If not, use `Layout`.
- Then decide the body. For a text-heavy page, nest `SimplePage` inside the layout. See `src/pages/2026/talks/[slug].astro` or `src/pages/[year]/sponsors/[slug].astro` for the pattern.
- `EventLayout` has a `hero` slot that renders above the Event nav (the 2026 landing page puts its video there). `SimplePage` has an `after-body` slot that renders outside the text column, which is where sponsor grids and testimonials go.
- **Pages own their sponsors section.** Only `MarkdownLayout` renders sponsors for you. On a hand-written page, place `SponsorsGrid` yourself and pass `year` (and `tiered`) or `exclude` as needed.

Wrap Markdown-derived HTML (an abstract, a description) in `MarkdownContent` to get prose styling for headings, lists and links.

## Content and data

### Content pages (`markdown/`)

The `markdown` collection schema in `src/content.config.ts` checks each file's frontmatter:

| Field              | Default    | Notes                                                              |
| :----------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`            | (required) | Title bar text. The route also builds the page's `<title>` from it |
| `description`      |            | Meta and Open Graph description                                    |
| `width`            | `narrow`   | `narrow` or `wide` content column                                  |
| `ogImage`          |            | Share image path under `public/`                                   |
| `showSponsors`     | `true`     | Append the sponsors section                                        |
| `showTestimonials` | `true`     | Append testimonials                                                |
| `published`        | `true`     | `false` leaves the page out of the build                           |

Reference images in `src/assets/` by alias: `![alt](@assets/images/example.jpg)`.

**Use `.md` unless you need a component.** Plain Markdown plus inline HTML covers most pages. Rename to `.mdx` only when the page imports and renders an Astro component (such as `CtaButton` or `Callout`). MDX is stricter:

- Void tags must self-close: `<br />`, not `<br>`.
- Literal `{` and `}` in text must be escaped as `\{` and `\}`.
- HTML comments aren't allowed. Use `{/* ... */}`.

See [ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-mdx-content-pages.md) and Astro's [MDX guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/).

### Data (`src/shared/data/`)

```text
src/shared/data/
  events/2026.config.ts   Event config: name, dates, venue, logo, nav, share defaults
  events.ts               Helpers: getEventConfig, getOrganizers, getTickets, getActivities, getActivity
  2026/                   The 2026 Event Dataset
    talks.json            Talks, each with an embedded speaker
    organizers.json
    tickets.json
    activities.json       Schedule items that aren't Talks (parties, hackathon, meals)
  sponsors.json           Every Sponsor, across all Events
  testimonials.json
  types.ts                Shared TypeScript types
```

You read data two ways:

- **Talks and Sponsors are content collections** (`talks2026`, `sponsors`), so read them with `getCollection("talks2026")` / `getEntry(...)` from `astro:content`. Their Zod schemas in `src/content.config.ts` are the single source of truth. TypeScript infers the types in `types.ts` (`Talk`, `Person`, `Sponsor`) from these schemas, so change the schema, not the type. Astro sorts collection entries by id, so each loader stamps an `order` field with the entry's position in the JSON file. Sort by `order` when a listing should follow file order.
- **Organizers, Tickets and Activities** come from the helpers in `events.ts`, keyed by year: `getTickets("2026")`. The helpers **throw on an unknown year or Activity id**, so a typo fails the build instead of rendering an empty section.

A Speaker isn't a separate record: it lives inside its Talk as `speaker`. Organizers use the same `Person` shape. Person images are paths under `src/assets/` (for example `/events/2026/images/jane-doe.jpg` means `src/assets/events/2026/images/jane-doe.jpg`), and the build fails if the file is missing.

For the reasoning behind this split, see [ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-event-pages-read-shared-datasets.md).

## Styling

Styling is Tailwind-first: use utility classes in markup, and use a `<style>` block only when Tailwind can't express the rule ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-tailwind-first-styling.md)).

Design tokens live in the `@theme` block of `src/styles/global.css`:

- **Colors:** `sound-navy`, `cascade-blue`, `emerald-city-green`, `madrona-yellow`, `seafoam-cream`, `ink`, `cedar-cream`, `overcast-gray`, `mint`, used as `bg-sound-navy`, `text-madrona-yellow`, and so on.
- **Fonts:** `font-sans`, `font-display`, `font-serif` (served by Adobe Typekit).
- **Extra font sizes:** named sizes like `text-21`, `text-40` for values outside Tailwind's scale.

Use a token before an arbitrary value. If you need a new color or size, add a token instead of one-off values like `text-[23px]`. This project configures Tailwind v4 in CSS, not in a `tailwind.config.js` file. See the [theme docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme).

Font Awesome icons are available site-wide (`<i class="fa-solid fa-...">`).

## Recipes

Checklists for the common changes. Run `pnpm dev` and open the page in a browser, then `pnpm check` and `pnpm lint`, before you push.

### Add or edit a content page

1. Create `markdown/<name>.md` for a site-wide page, or `markdown/<year>/<name>.md` for an Event page.
2. Add frontmatter: at least `title`, and usually `description`. See the [field table](#content-pages-markdown).
3. Only if it needs a component: use `.mdx` and import the component with an alias.
4. Link to it without a trailing slash.

### Add a Talk and Speaker

1. Add an object to `src/shared/data/<year>/talks.json`, at the position where the Talk should appear. Required fields: `id`, `slug` (or `null` for no Talk page), `title`, `type` (`keynote`, `main`, `lightning`, `workshop`) and `speaker`. Optional fields: `abstract` (Markdown), `tags`, `yt`.
2. Put the speaker photo in `src/assets/events/<year>/images/` and reference it in `speaker.image`.
3. Optional: add a share card at `public/images/<year>/share/speaker-<name-slug>.png`. The Talk page uses it when the file exists.
4. For a Workshop with a registration page, set `registrationUrl` to a site-relative path and add the page under `markdown/<year>/workshops/`.
5. Place it on the schedule. Add a `<TalkItem talk="<id>" />` in `src/pages/<year>/schedule.astro`. Workshops use `ShowItem` instead, so copy an existing Workshop entry. The schedule shows only the Talks you place on it.

### Add a Sponsor

1. If they're new, add an object to `src/shared/data/sponsors.json`: `id`, `name`, `logo` (filename), optional `tier`, `url`, `description` (Markdown), `video`. Existing sponsors only need the year added to `events`.
2. Put the logo in `src/assets/images/sponsors/`.
3. Set `events` to every Event Key they sponsored, oldest first (e.g. `["2025", "2026"]`).
4. A `description` gives them a detail page at `/<year>/sponsors/<id>` for each year in `events` that has Event pages.

### Add an Organizer, Ticket or Activity

1. Edit the matching file in `src/shared/data/<year>/` (`organizers.json`, `tickets.json`, `activities.json`). The shapes are in `src/shared/data/types.ts`.
2. Organizer photos go in `src/assets/events/<year>/images/`.
3. A new Activity also needs placing on the schedule: reference it by `id` from `src/pages/<year>/schedule.astro` with `getActivity(year, id)`.

### Add a component

1. Create `src/components/<Name>.astro` (or a subfolder for a family, like `schedule/`).
2. Type its props with an `interface Props`, and use the shared types from `@shared/data/types` where they fit.
3. Style with Tailwind utilities and tokens.
4. If Markdown pages should use it, import it from an `.mdx` page.

### Launching a new Event

This happens once a year and touches several places. The steps below use 2027 as the example.

Start with config and data. Create `src/shared/data/events/2027.config.ts` modelled on `2026.config.ts` (name, dates, venue, logo, nav, share defaults). `events.ts` globs these configs, so the new file alone enables the `markdown/2027/` and `/2027/sponsors/*` pages. Add `"2027"` to the `events` enum in `sponsorSchema` in `src/content.config.ts`: `EventYear` derives from it, so nothing type-checks with `"2027"` until you do. Then create `src/shared/data/2027/` with `talks.json`, `organizers.json`, `tickets.json` and `activities.json`, and register a `talks2027` collection in `src/content.config.ts` next to `talks2026`.

Next, the pages. Each Event has its own hand-written landing page, schedule and Talk pages. Create `src/pages/2027/` from the 2026 pages, then change the year and the collection name. Content pages go in `markdown/2027/`. Images go in `src/assets/events/2027/images/`, and share images go in `public/images/2027/share/`. Add `"2027"` to the `events` of each 2027 Sponsor.

Flip the launch switch on launch day, once the 2027 pages are ready: set `FEATURED_EVENT` to `"2027"` and update `DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION` in `src/shared/site-defaults.ts`. The homepage, header, footer and site-wide pages read that value. Then run the full test suite. Several tests read `FEATURED_EVENT` and the data files, so they also change with the switch.

## Going live

Indexing and analytics switch on by themselves when a build is _live_: a Netlify production build whose main address is cascadiajs.com (`isLiveSite` in `src/shared/live-site.ts`, decision in [ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-indexing-and-analytics-only-on-the-live-site.md)). Every other build stays hidden and untracked.

1. Add cascadiajs.com as the main domain in Netlify.
2. **Redeploy production.** `URL` is read at build time, so skipping this launches with `noindex` and no analytics.
3. Flip DNS.
4. Check by hand (CI never builds the live site): robots.txt allows crawling and lists the sitemap; `/sitemap.xml` 301s to `/sitemap-index.xml`; a Layout page and a Frozen Snapshot page (`/2024`, `/2025`) have no `noindex` and have both the GA4 and Meta Pixel snippets.

The 2024 and 2025 snapshots keep their analytics in `ANALYTICS DORMANT` comments. An integration in `astro.config.mjs` fails the build if those markers disappear, and on a live build uncomments them in `dist`. Never edit the snapshot sources for this.

## Testing and CI

End-to-end tests live in `e2e/` and use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro). They run against a production build (`pnpm build && pnpm preview`), the same output Netlify deploys.

```sh
pnpm exec playwright install chromium   # once, to download the browser
pnpm test                               # whole suite
pnpm test e2e/talks.spec.ts             # one file
pnpm test --ui                          # Playwright's interactive runner
```

Many tests generate their cases from the data files. For example, one test checks that each Talk with a slug has a page. Another test checks that each Sponsor with a description has a detail page. In most cases, new data needs no new tests. Add or update a spec when you add a page, a route or a behavior.

If a dev server is already running on port 4321, Playwright reuses it instead of building. Stop `pnpm dev` before `pnpm test` if you want to test the real build.

CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs on every PR and push to `main`:

1. **checks:** `pnpm lint`, `prettier --check .`, `pnpm check`
2. **build:** `pnpm build`
3. **playwright:** the e2e suite, after both pass. On failure, download the `playwright-report` artifact from the run to see what failed.

## Working with an agent

You can work on this repo by hand. If you use a coding agent such as Claude Code or Codex, it relies on the files below.

### What the agent reads

- **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)**: Claude Code loads it at the start of every session, and `AGENTS.md` symlinks to it for other tools. It's the agent's rulebook and source of truth: stack, package manager, import rules, what's out of scope, and what it must never touch. This README explains the same project to people, so keep the two consistent. If you change a rule, change `CLAUDE.md`.
- **[`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md)** and **[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)** give the agent the domain vocabulary and past decisions. Skills read them before exploring code, and flag it when a change would contradict an ADR.
- **[`docs/agents/`](docs/agents/)** tells skills where issues live and which labels mean what.

### Repo hooks (Claude Code)

`.claude/settings.json` wires two hooks:

- **Dependency install on session start.** In cloud sessions (Claude Code on the web), it runs `pnpm install` so `node_modules` matches the lockfile. It does nothing locally.
- **Git guardrails.** It blocks the agent from running destructive git commands: `git push`, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`, force pushes. You decide what leaves your machine.

### Skills

The skills come from [Matt Pocock's skills collection](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), installed in `.agents/skills/` and pinned in `skills-lock.json`. Skim that repo's README to learn the philosophy. In Claude Code, invoke a skill with `/<name>`.

The repo installs more skills than we use. We use these:

| Skill                           | Use it when                                                                                                                  | Example                                                         |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grill-with-docs`               | You have an idea or plan and want it stress-tested before building. It also updates `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs as decisions land | `/grill-with-docs I want speaker pages to show past talks`      |
| `to-spec`                       | You and the agent agreed what to build. Turn that into an issue                                                              | `/to-spec`                                                      |
| `to-tickets`                    | A spec is too big for one PR. Split it into issues in blocking order                                                         | `/to-tickets #42`                                               |
| `triage`                        | Issues need evaluating, labelling, and agent-ready briefs                                                                    | `/triage`                                                       |
| `implement`                     | Build an issue or spec end to end                                                                                            | `/implement #57`                                                |
| `tdd`                           | Build or fix something test-first (red, green, refactor)                                                                     | `/tdd the schedule should hide unpublished activities`          |
| `diagnosing-bugs`               | Something is broken, flaky or slow and the cause isn't obvious                                                               | `/diagnosing-bugs sponsor logos 404 on /2026/sponsors/temporal` |
| `code-review`                   | Review a branch against the repo's standards and its originating issue                                                       | `/code-review since main`                                       |
| `improve-codebase-architecture` | Periodically, to find modules worth deepening or simplifying                                                                 | `/improve-codebase-architecture`                                |
| `handoff`                       | A session is long. Give its context to a new agent                                                                           | `/handoff`                                                      |

### A typical flow

1. **Shape it.** `/grill-with-docs` on the idea until the open questions are gone.
2. **Record it.** `/to-spec` creates the issue. If the issue is large, `/to-tickets` splits it.
3. **Triage.** `/triage` labels each ticket `ready-for-agent` or `ready-for-human`.
4. **Build.** Run `/implement` (or `/tdd`) on an agent-ready ticket. Do the human-ready tickets yourself.
5. **Review.** `/code-review` before opening the PR, then human review on the PR.
6. If the session runs long, `/handoff` and continue in a fresh one.

Agents do well here when the issue is specific. For example, "Add the 2027 tickets from this table" works. "Make the tickets section better" does not.

## Gotchas

- **No trailing slashes** in URLs or links. See [Pages and routing](#pages-and-routing).
- **`.md` vs `.mdx`:** use `.mdx` only for pages that render components, and follow its stricter syntax. See [Content pages](#content-pages-markdown).
- **Alias imports** across `src/` directories, never `../components/...`. ESLint enforces it. See [Imports](#imports).
